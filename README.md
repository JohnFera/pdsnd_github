Note: With end of this Nanodegree program and all other Nanodegree programs; this will no longer be able to submit the GitHub Review.

## Overview Project Explore US.Bikeshare Data
This project make used of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. In this project I writef code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have writed a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
This project have used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## How to run the script
